Trace through the located code to determine what parts can be controlled by the input data. Some examples:
- If they are setting up an http request (even a local unit test version) can you control any headers, url, query arguments, form data, etc?
- If they import and call any method on a Jenkins plugin or other jenkins stapler class (for example as a way to test a http endpoint), what arguments of the call are controlled? These will likely equate to @QueryParameter in a `doXXXXX` stapler method call.
- If there are limitations or filtering on the input data, what are they and how does it restrict any of the previous points?
- Any other useful information you can gather about the code that will help you understand how the input data can be used to control the code.

Be as detailed as possible in your analysis.

For each fact you discover about the code, include a 1-2 line code snippet as proof. If you notice that the code snippet does not actually support your fact, then you may need to re-evaluate your understanding of the code for that fact.
