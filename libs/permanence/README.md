# Permanence

LibPermanence is there to help us preserve critical information from our CI-runs. The idea here is to use the next few months of CI runs to collect data like grammars that hit unique functions, seeds that hit unique functions, valid patches for deduplicated PoI reports, etc. such that we can collect them into a dataset.
