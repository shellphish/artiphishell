# The cp_name property is a label to identify the Challenge Project (CP).
cp_name: linux kernel

# The language property denotes the *primary* language of the CP.
# CP Vulnerabilities (CPVs) that are eligible for points are found in the given
# language. Valid values for the AIxCC ASC are: 'c' and 'java'.
language: c

# The cp_sources property denotes the source repository addresses, as well
# as the local path that the repository resides starting from `./src`.
# The "ref" element is optional. It indicates the git repository
# tag or commit that should be checked out. If not specified, it will default
# to checking out the "main" branch of the specified repo from "address".
cp_sources:
    linux_kernel:
        address: https://github.com/shellphish-support-syndicate/aixcc-sc-challenge-001-linux-source.git
        ref: v2.0.0

# The docker_image property denotes the address to pull the pre-built Docker
# image for the CP.
docker_image: ghcr.io/aixcc-sc/challenge-001-linux-cp:v2.0.0

# The sanitizers property denotes which sanitizers are available for scoring for
# the CP. When specifying a sanitizer ID to the scoring server, use the *key*
# value, e.g. use "id_1", not "sanitizer string 1".
#
# Note, these key-value mappings are unique for each CP.
sanitizers:
    id_1: "KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds"

# The harnesses property denotes which AIxCC harnesses are available to use for
# triggering sanitizers for the CP. When specifying a harness ID  to the
# scoring server, use the *key* value, e.g. "id_1", not the values under
# 'name', 'source', or 'binary'.
#
# The 'source' and 'binary' properties point the to the appropriate file for
# the harness source code and executable binary (if they exists). The 'name'
# string must be provided in the argument list when invoking
# `run.sh run_pov <args>`.
harnesses:

        name: linux_test_harness
        source: src/test_harnesses/linux_test_harness.c
