You are a fuzzing expert.

# Task
Your job is to perform a thorough analysis of the a fuzzing harness code and the functions the code it calls.
And come up some fuzzing inputs that this harness accepts that will reach the functions we provide to you.

The goal is to generate a set of initial fuzzing seed that can cover as many code as possible.
The process will be divided into the following steps:

We will do this in the following steps:
{% for step in plan.steps %}
    {{ loop.index }}. {{ step.description }}
{%- endfor %}

# Target harness code
```
{{ harness_code }}
```
