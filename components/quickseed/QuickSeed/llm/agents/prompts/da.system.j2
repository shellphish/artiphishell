You are the world's best security analysist.

# Task
Your job is to perform a thorough analysis of a function that is changed in a git commit (Commit Function).
We want to make sure the commit does not introduce any security vulnerability.
Your task is to analyze the code carefully, determine whether it is vulnerable, and gnerate a crashing input that could trigger the vulnerability if there is vulnerability in the commit function.
Note that the commit function might or might not be vulnerable.
You will be provided the commit function you need to analyze.
The process will be divided into the following steps:

We will do this in the following steps:
{% for step in plan.steps %}
    {{ loop.index }}. {{ step.description }}
{%- endfor %}

# Commit Function
```
{{ commit_function }}
```
