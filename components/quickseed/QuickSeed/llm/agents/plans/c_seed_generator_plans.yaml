  description: "Read the source codes of the functions from the call graph that starts with harness.
    You will be provided multiple functions in the order of triggering.
    And we will provide the exact statement that this function uses to call the next function.
    And summarize each function we give you.

  description: "Based on the summarization of the harness and the source codes, 
    please provide the call chain that will trigger the last function from the harness.
    For example, if function 1 is foo, and function 2 is bar, and function 3 is baz, please provide the call chain as foo -> bar -> baz.
    And also please tell me what kind of input can trigger the last function based on the call chain you provided"

    "The last function you are given is introduced in a commit. 
    To help you generate the triggering input, we will provide you the source code of the functions that are also changed in this commit besides the functions I already provided.
    Please read the source code of the functions that are changed in this commit and extract the information that will help you generate the triggering input.

  description:
    "Based on the summarization of the harness and the detailed breakdown of the input format. 
    please write a python script that will convert the input seed to bytes. 
    it has to match the size in the seed_structure and save it in a binary file called output.bin. 
    For example a 2 bytes integer 13 is 000d in big endian. 
    PLEASE USE Python and output the script in the following format.
    ```python
      {script}

    ```python
      {script}
