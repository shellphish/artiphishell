# TASK: IDENTIFY HARNESS INPUT FILE FORMATS

You are an expert reverse engineer. Your task is to analyze the provided harness source code and identify all input file formats that the harness accepts.

IMPORTANT: You are identifying input file formats specifically for this harness, not for the entire program.

# PROJECT: {{ project_name }}
# HARNESS: {{ harness_name }}

# HARNESS SOURCE CODE
```
{{ harness_source_code }}
```

# VALID FILE FORMATS
You may only identify formats from this list:
{{ valid_file_formats }}

When you identify a format with clear evidence in the code, call add_harness_input_file_format(format).
If no formats can be identified or you've exhausted all possibilities, call give_up_on_task(reason).

All responses must follow: "Given that <findings>, we should <action plan>".
