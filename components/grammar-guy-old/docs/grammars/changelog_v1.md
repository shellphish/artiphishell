1. You wrote this grammar for me. Please make it 5 times as likely not to get empty output from it. 
2. Add a rule that introduces flags to the created json
3. Make it more likely for the grammar to create json files that contains flags
4. **(Coverage decreased) allowed LLM to use diff.**
  - The last change decreased coverage on the function clib_package_new. Given this diff file, can you adjust your changes to generate jsons that have more flags without reducing coverage?
5. **Coverage slightly increased (diff provided)**
  - Great! The last changes increased coverage. Can you add more rules that hit clib_package_new. so that coverage increases? Here is the diff containing all the changes made to the original grammar
6. The rules "nestedObject" and "nestedArray" in this grammar are unreachable. The last changes decreased coverage. Consider these first line of the functions source code and adjust the json to achieve more coverage: (**provide source code**)
   -  Additionally, here is the diff of all changes made so far. (**provide diff**)
7. Rebuild the grammar to incorporate all the above more efficiently
8. Add rules to hit this part of the source code: 
    - (gave part of function source code)
9. The mandatory members can appear at the same time.  Please account for this

**- MORE ITERATIONS - SET TO 100k -**

10. Add a rule that allows creation of invalid json files
