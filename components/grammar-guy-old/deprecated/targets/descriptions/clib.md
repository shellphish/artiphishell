### CLib Library Overview

**CLib** is a C library manager that allows developers to manage dependencies in their C projects efficiently. It is designed to simplify the process of including and maintaining third-party libraries in C projects, making it easier to build and distribute C applications.

#### Features
- **Dependency Management**: Automatically handles downloading and integrating third-party libraries.
- **Version Control**: Supports versioning to ensure compatibility and stability.
- **Repository Integration**: Works with repositories like GitHub to fetch libraries.
- **Build Integration**: Can be integrated with build systems like Makefiles or CMake.

#### Source Files
The source code of the CLib library typically includes the following key files:

1. **main.c**: The main entry point for the command-line interface (CLI) of the CLib tool.
2. **clib.c**: Core implementation file containing the primary functions for managing libraries.
3. **clib.h**: Header file declaring the functions and structures used in the CLib library.
4. **utils.c**: Utility functions for handling various tasks such as file operations and string manipulations.
5. **utils.h**: Header file for utility functions.
6. **json.c**: Functions for parsing and generating JSON, often used for reading package manifests.
7. **json.h**: Header file for JSON functions.
8. **package.c**: Functions for handling package definitions and dependencies.
9. **package.h**: Header file for package functions.
10. **Makefile**: Build script for compiling the CLib tool.

#### Main Functions
- **Library Management**:
  - `clib_install(const char *package_name)`: Installs a specified package.
  - `clib_search(const char *query)`: Searches for packages matching the query.
  - `clib_update()`: Updates all installed packages to their latest versions.

- **Package Handling**:
  - `clib_package_load(const char *path)`: Loads a package definition from a file.
  - `clib_package_install(const char *path)`: Installs a package from a given path.

- **Utility Functions**:
  - `clib_read_file(const char *path)`: Reads the content of a file.
  - `clib_write_file(const char *path, const char *data)`: Writes data to a file.
