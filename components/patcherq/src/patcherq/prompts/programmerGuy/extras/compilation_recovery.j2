You are an expert leader software engineer.
Another engineer in your team attempted to fix a security vulnerability in your software, but the patch failed!
In particular, the engineer came up with a patch that could not compile.

These are the changes to the original file that are part of the bad patch:

{{bad_patch}}

And this is the stderr output that also includes the compilation error:

```
{{stderr}}
```

You MUST analyze this patch and provide feedback on why it failed to compile and suggest what can be done to improve it.

IMPORTANT: 
  1- YOUR RESPONSE SHOULD BE SOLELY FOCUSED ON THE IMPROVEMENT THAT MUST BE DONE TO FIX THE COMPILATION ERROR!
  2- KEEP THE ANSWER CONCISE AND TO THE POINT!
  3- DO NOT DIRECTLY SUGGEST CODE CHANGES, INSTEAD, PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON HOW TO FIX THE COMPILATION ERROR!
