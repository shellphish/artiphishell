# Code Swipe Architecture

## Component Overview

The Code Swipe component is structured as a pipeline of filtering and prioritization passes that process code blocks. The architecture is designed to be:
- Modular: Easy to add new filtering passes
- Parallel: Efficient processing of large codebases within a single filter pass
- Extensible: Support for additional languages and analysis types

## System Components

### Collection System
- Processes function index data from Clang/Java indexers
- Creates code block representations
- Handles delta mode changes
- No direct parsing of source code

### Filter Pass Framework
- Manages pass registration and execution
- Handles pass dependencies and ordering
- Supports parallel execution
- Maintains scoring system

### Output Management
- Prioritized list generation
- Metadata aggregation
- Future streaming support

## Data Flow

1. Input Processing:
   - Function index data (required)
   - CodeQL results (optional)
   - Coverage data (optional)
   - Delta changes (if applicable)

2. Code Block Creation:
   - Function/method level granularity
   - Metadata attachment
   - Language-specific information

3. Pass Execution:
   - Parallel processing where possible
   - Resource-aware scheduling
   - Error containment

4. Result Generation:
   - Priority scoring
   - Metadata compilation
   - Output formatting

## Integration Points

### Required Dependencies
- Function indexing system
- CRS utilities for models

### Optional Dependencies
- CodeQL analysis
- Coverage data
- Quick seed results or other input seed sources

## Resource Management

### CPU Utilization
- Configurable worker pools
- Pass-level parallelization (inside each pass, passes overall should be sync, but we can run analysis inside the pass in parallel)

## Error Handling

### Failure Modes
- Individual pass failures
- Input data issues

### Recovery Strategies
- Partial results handling
- Graceful degradation
- Error reporting (esp metrics and analytics)

## Future Considerations

### Integration
- Streaming output support
- Enhanced component interaction
- Additional data sources
