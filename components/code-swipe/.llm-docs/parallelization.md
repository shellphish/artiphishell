# Code Swipe Parallelization

## Parallelization Levels

### Pass-Level Parallelization
- Concurrent filter execution (running against multiple code blocks in within a single filter pass)
- Result aggregation

## Resource Management

### CPU Resources
- Configurable worker pools
- Task scheduling
- Priority management
- Load monitoring

*This document will be updated as parallelization features are implemented and refined.*
