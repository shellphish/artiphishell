# Code Swipe Testing

## Testing Philosophy

### Initial Focus
- Write a few unit tests as we go, not super important, functionality is more important
- Tests for main functionality of block loader / filter runner
- Individual tests for each filter
- Minimal integration testing
- Clear test specifications

### Future Expansion
- Integration testing (via ci test scripts)
- Performance testing
- Validation testing
- Error handling verification

## Test Data

### Mock Objects
- Code block representations
- Filter results
- Configuration data
- Resource states

### Test Cases
- Known vulnerabilities
- Edge cases
- Error conditions
- Performance scenarios

## Testing Infrastructure

### Test Framework
- To be determined

*This document will be updated as testing infrastructure is developed.*
