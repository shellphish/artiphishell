## Output format
After completing the analysis, you MUST output a report in the specified format.

<reasoning_process>Some reasoning process..</reasoning_process>
<vuln_detect>
## Final Answer
#judge: <yes/no>
#type: <vulnerability type>
</vuln_detect>

## Additional Constraint:
- If `#judge: yes`, then `#type:` **must contain exactly one CWE**.
- If `#judge: yes`, the model must output **only the most probable CWE** related to the given code snippet.

## Example
- If the target function is vulnerable to a CWE-79, you should finally output:
<reasoning_process>Some reasoning process..</reasoning_process>
<vuln_detect>
## Final Answer
#judge: yes
#type: CWE-79
</vuln_detect>

- If the target function does not contain vulnerabilities related to the given CWE, you should finally output:
<reasoning_process>Some reasoning process..</reasoning_process>
<vuln_detect>
## Final Answer
#judge: no
#type: N/A
</vuln_detect>
