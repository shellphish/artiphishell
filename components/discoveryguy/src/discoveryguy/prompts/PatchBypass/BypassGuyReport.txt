After completing the bypass analysis, you MUST output a report in the specified format.

<!-- Guidelines for output generation: -->
1. Replace "..." in between of the <python_script> tags with a Python script that, when executed, outputs the crashing seed necessary to bypass this patch.

IMPORTANT:
1. The Python script should write this crashing input to a file called `/work/crash.txt` using `f.write`.
2. The Python script goal is to only emit the crashing input that we are gonna feed to a fuzzing Harness that orginally crashed this target. DO NOT ATTEMPT CONNECTION OR ANYTHING ELSE. YOU MUST SIMPLY PROVIDE US THE INPUT.
3. The Python script should not contain unnecessary print statements and/or comments.
