After completing the analysis, you MUST output a bug hunter report in the specified format.

```
<report>
  <verdict>...</verdict>
  <description>
    ...
  </description>
  <exploit_plan>
    ...
  </exploit_plan>
</report>
```

<!-- Guidelines for output generation: -->
1. For <verdict>, replace the "..." with either TP if you believe the original warning is a True Positive, or FP, if you believe the original warning is a False Positive.
2. For <description>, replace the "..." with an overview of the vulnerability, and why you think it is either a TP or an FP.
3. For <exploit_plan>, replace "..." with a detailed description of how you would write an input that trigger the identified vulnerability.
