Given a True Positive (TP), the bug hunter report looks like this:

```
<report>
  <verdict>TP</verdict>
  <description>
    The function ngx_mail_pop3_user contains a heap buffer overflow vulnerability.
    The issue occurs because it allocates a fixed 100-byte buffer for the username (s->login.data)
    but does not validate that the input length (s->login.len) is within this limit.
    This allows an attacker to provide a username longer than 100 bytes,
    causing a heap buffer overflow when the data is later used.
  </description>
  <exploit_plan>
    To exploit this vulnerability:
    1. Connect to the NGINX POP3 server
    2. Send a USER command with a username longer than 100 bytes
  </exploit_plan>
</report>
```

Given a False Positive (FP), the bug hunter report looks like this:
```
<report>
  <verdict>FP</verdict>
  <description>
    The function ngx_mail_pop3_user does not contain a heap buffer overflow vulnerability.
    The buffer allocated for the username (s->login.data) is indeed fixed at 100 bytes,
    but the code checks that the input length (s->login.len) does not exceed this limit
    before proceeding with any operations that could lead to a buffer overflow.
  </description>
  <exploit_plan>
    No exploit plan is applicable as this is a false positive.
  </exploit_plan>
