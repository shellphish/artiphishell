After completing the analysis, you MUST output a report in the specified format.

<report>
<exploit_script>
...
</exploit_script>
</report>

<!-- Guidelines for output generation: -->
1. Replace "..." with a Python script that, when executed, outputs the crashing seed necessary to exploit this vulnerability.

IMPORTANT:
1. The Python script should write this crashing input to a file called `/work/crash.txt` using `f.write`.
2. The Python script goal is to only emit the crashing input that we are gonna feed to a fuzzing Harness. DO NOT ATTEMPT CONNECTION OR ANYTHING ELSE. YOU MUST SIMPLY PROVIDE US THE INPUT.
3. The Python script should not contain unnecessary print statements and/or comments.
4. The size of the seed MUST be under 2MB.
5. DO NOT USE JAVA CODE OR IMPORT JAVA LIBRARIES IN PYTHON CODE!!!! If there are java libraries inside the script, you must correct it.
