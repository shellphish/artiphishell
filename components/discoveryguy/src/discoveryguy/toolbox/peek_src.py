    in the project directory and returns all matching lines. Use this to find function definitions,
    variable usages, conditional statements, etc.

    Because grep interprets special characters, you must escape any regex metacharacters
    (e.g., backslashes, quotes, brackets) in `expression` so they're passed correctly to the shell.

    Example:
        To locate all uses of "obj->param", search for "->param" instead of "obj->param".
        This will match every occurrence of "->param" regardless of the object prefix.

    :param expression: A POSIX ERE (extended regex) pattern. Escape any special characters
