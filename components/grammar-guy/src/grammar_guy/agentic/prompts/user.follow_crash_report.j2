# TASK: REPRODUCE AND TRIGGER THE CRASH REPORT WITH YOUR GRAMMAR

Your task is to write a grammar that can rediscover the crash given in the stacktrace and reproduces the full sanitizer crash.

If you haven't yet discovered a call trace to the target function, please do so.
You MUST first explore the code from the harness until you have seen a call in the code of the application before you are allowed to write a grammar.
If you have already discovered this call, please write a grammar that reaches the target function {{ target_name }}?
Otherwise, resume your exploration.
Lastly, if you have already written a grammar, please evaluate its success using the coverage tool.
If the target function is not reached, backtrack up the call trace using the coverage to discover where the grammar is stuck.

# HARNESS CODE ({{ harness_index }})
```
{{ harness_source_code }}
```

# TARGET FUNCTION ({{ target_name }})
```
{{ target }}
```

{% if example_grammars %}
# EXAMPLE GRAMMARS ILLUSTRATING THE GRAMMAR FORMAT
{% for example_grammar in example_grammars %}
```python
{{ example_grammar }}
```
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

# CRASH TO REPRODUCE

You are being asked to specifically follow and reproduce this crash report. To do this, you must write a grammar that reaches the target function and
follows the stack trace indicated by the crash report.


The following information is known about how the sanitizer you are attempting to reproduce works.
```
{{ crash_to_repro.sanitizer_info }}
```

The crash report you must reproduce is the following:
```
{{ crash_to_repro.report }}
```

You must write a grammar that triggers the sanitizer with the exact same value as shown in the 'SHELLPHISH_EXPECTED_LOSAN' provided as part of the crash report.
