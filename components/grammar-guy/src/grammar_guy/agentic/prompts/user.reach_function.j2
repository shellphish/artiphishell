# TASK: REACH THE TARGET FUNCTION {{ target_name }}

If you haven't yet discovered a call trace to the target function, please do so.
You MUST first explore the code from the harness until you have seen a call in the code of the application before you are allowed to write a grammar.
If you have already discovered this call, please write a grammar that reaches the target function {{ target_name }}?
Otherwise, resume your exploration.
Lastly, if you have already written a grammar, please evaluate its success using the coverage tool.
If the target function is not reached, backtrack up the call trace using the coverage to discover where the grammar is stuck.
