# PatcherY
PatcherY is the next-generation [Patcherex](https://github.com/angr/patcherex), targeting source code and buildable
projects. 

## Installation
For now, please install using the development env:
```bash
pip install -e .[test]
```

### Verification 
Verify the installation by running pytest (must be on an X86 machine), this should take a max of 5 minutes:
```bash
pytest tests/test_core.py
```

This will require you to have `Git` installed and have a `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable set.
Everything should pass.

## AIxCC Usage (independent) 
Normal runs from the command line look something like this:
```bash 
patchery --generate-verified-patch \
  --src-root ./tests/targets/hamlin/challenge/src/ \
  --run-script ./tests/targets/hamlin/challenge/run.sh \
  --lang "C++" \
  --report-file ./tests/reports/hamlin_report.txt \
  ...
  --output-path "./output.patch"
```

The best way to understand how to run it is looking at the [test_aicc.py](/tests/test_aicc.py) file.

### Linux Example
Most of the AICC targets supported can be found as a single end-to-end test in the [test_aicc.py](/tests/test_aicc.py) file.
As an example, you can run just the Linux Kernel test with:
```bash
docker build -f tests/Dockerfile -t aixcc-patchery-tests .
pytest tests/test_aicc.py::TestPatcheryAICC::test_linux_tipc -s 
```

### OSS-FUZZ Example
```bash
export ENABLE_LLM_ANALYZER=1
export OSS_FUZZ_TARGET=1
export AGENTLIB_SAVE_FILES=0
pytest tests/test_ossfuzz.py::TestPatcheryOssFuzz::test_ossfuzz_xs_47443 -s -v
```

This will take around 10 mins to run with all verification steps.
An example of the output is:

## AIxCC Pipeline Usage
For using this in the full pipeline, which is run with `pydatatask`, you can see the [patch.sh](/patch.sh) script file.
Normal runs from the command line look something like this:
```bash 
patchery --generate-verified-patch \
  --src-root ./tests/targets/hamlin/challenge/src/ \
  --run-script ./tests/targets/hamlin/challenge/run.sh \
  --lang "C++" \
  --report-file ./tests/reports/hamlin_report.txt \
  ...
  --output-path "./output.patch"
```

This results in a patch at the specified output path.

## Patch Ranking
PatcherY uses a ranking system to determine the best patch in the presence of multiple verified patches.
To use the ranker, you can run the following command:
```bash
patchery --continuous-ranking \
  --rank-patches /mock_cp/resources/patches/ \
  --rank-output-dir /mock_cp/resources/patches/ \
  --rank-timeout 10 --rank-wait-time 3
```

This runs the ranker in a loop for a max of `10` seconds and an in-loop wait for `3` seconds.
This will have output on stdout like so, every `3` seconds:
```
INFO     | 2024-07-04 21:06:55,663 | patchery.ranker.patch_ranker | Ranking output written to patch_ranks_1720152415.json
...
```

The output format looks like this:
```json
{
  "ranks": [
    "/mock_cp/resources/patches/patch.sdasda", 
    "/mock_cp/resources/patches/patch.aaaaaa"
  ], 
  "invalidated_patches": [], 
  "patch_info": {
    "/mock_cp/resources/patches/patch.sdasda": 7.467698726104354, 
    "/mock_cp/resources/patches/patch.aaaaaa": 8.622736323949841
  }, 
  "timestamp": 1720152415
}
```




## Model Alias

In the configuration, model aliases are used to simplify referencing different models. Below are the aliases and their corresponding original models:
### OpenAI Models
